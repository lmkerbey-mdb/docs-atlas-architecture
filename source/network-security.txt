{+service+} is pre-configured with secure default settings. You can
fine-tune the security features for your database deployments to meet
your unique security needs and preferences.

Use the foundational guidance on this page to plan network security
configuration for your {+clusters+}.

{+service+} Features and Best Practices for Network Security
------------------------------------------------------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

{+service+} requires TLS/SSL to encrypt the connections to your
databases. All {+service+} projects with one or more M10+ dedicated
{+clusters+} receive their own dedicated VPC (or VNet if you use
|azure|). {+service+} deploys all dedicated clusters inside this VPC
or VNet. By default, this VPC or VNet allows no inbound access to
{+service+}, requiring you to explicitly enable access by doing one of
the following:

- Add public IP addresses to your IP access list
- Use VPC / VNet peering to add private IP addresses
- Add private endpoints

If your firewall blocks outbound network connections, you must also
open outbound access from your application environment to
{+service+}. You must configure your firewall to allow your
applications to make outbound connections to TCP traffic on
{+service+} hosts. This grants your applications access to databases
stored on {+service+}.

{+service+} {+cluster+} public IPs remain the same in the majority of
cases of {+cluster+} changes: vertical scaling, topology changes,
maintenance events, healing events, etc. However, certain topology
changes – such as a conversion from replica set to sharded cluster, an
addition of shards, or a region change – will require new IP addresses
be used.
